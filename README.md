# Natural Language Processing Project on Detecting Negative Comments

## Overview:
This project aims to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify negative comments posted on social media platforms. By highlighting these comments, the objective is to promote positive content and foster a more constructive online community.

## Notebooks:

### 1. **baseline_model_1.ipynb**:
- **Purpose**: Establishes a basic model for the project.
- **Key Features**:
  - Installation of `indic-nlp-library`.
  - Usage of `LogisticRegression` and `TfidfVectorizer`.
  - Data loading from Google Drive.

### 2. **baseline_model_2.ipynb**:
- **Purpose**: Explores a more advanced model for the project.
- **Key Features**:
  - Utilizes deep learning libraries like `keras`.
  - Imports a diverse set of libraries for data processing and modeling.

### 3. **hypothesis_1.ipynb**:
- **Purpose**: Experiments with transformer-based models for NLP tasks.
- **Key Features**:
  - Installation and use of the `transformers` library.
  - Configuration settings for model parameters, data paths, and more.
  - Data loading and preprocessing.

### 4. **hypothesis_2.ipynb**:
- **Purpose**: Possible extension or modification of the experiments conducted in "hypothesis_1.ipynb".
- **Key Features**: Similar to "hypothesis_1.ipynb".

### 5. **proposed_model.ipynb**:
- **Purpose**: Likely the final model or a refined version based on findings from previous hypotheses.
- **Key Features**: Similar structure as the hypothesis notebooks but might contain further optimizations or model refinements.

## Report:
The accompanying report provides detailed insights into the objectives, methodologies, and findings of the project. Key highlights:
- Use of the MuRIL model, which outperforms other models in interpreting semantic expressions.
- References to previous works in the domain of hate speech detection, primarily in English.
- A brief overview of the BERT-based architecture utilized.
